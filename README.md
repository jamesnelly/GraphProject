This repository is owned by the James Nelly Student at GMIT.
============================================
The project consists of three main parts, the first part is the shunting yard algorithm where I give it the algoritm 
an infix regular expression to convert too a postfix regular expression.

That then feeds into the second part of the project where I set up thompson's algorithm
it takes the postfix regular expression and converts that into an NFA.

the Third and last part of the project is the matching algorithm where its checks if this regular expression matches this string, 
if matching is correct its in the accept state, then check if it matches the postfix regular expression.
